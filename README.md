Maze Project 🎮🧩

Welcome to **The Maze**, a thrilling 3D maze game built using C and SDL2! This project transforms a 2D map into an immersive 3D world using ray casting, offering an exciting and interactive experience.

## 🚀 Overview

**The Maze** is written in C and uses the SDL2 library for rendering graphics and handling input. It was developed on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using gcc (Ubuntu 4.8.4-2ubuntu1~14.04) 4.8.4.

### About SDL2

SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) is a cross-platform development library designed to provide low-level access to:
- Audio
- Keyboard and mouse input
- Joystick
- Graphics hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D

It is commonly used in video playback software, emulators, and popular games, including Valve’s award-winning catalog.

## 🛠️ Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jimal254/The-Maze.git.
```

## Compilation
To compile the game, use the following command:

```bash
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic ./src/*.c -lm -o maze `sdl2-config --cflags` `sdl2-config --libs`;
```
## 🎮 Usage
```bash
./maze
```
Alternatively, you can use the make run command if you have make configured.

Controls:
Move Forward/Backward: Up/Down arrow keys (or W/S)
Rotate Camera: Left/Right arrow keys (or A/D)
## 🏆 Gameplay Objective
The primary goal is to navigate through the maze and find the exit. Movement is controlled via the arrow keys, where:

The left/right arrow keys (or A/D) rotate the player.
The up/down arrow keys (or W/S) move the player forward or backward.
The player's starting position and maze goal can be customized through the map file. If no custom position is provided, the player begins at the top-left corner, and the goal will be placed at the last accessible floor tile.

Upon reaching the maze exit, the game either progresses to the next maze or ends, displaying a win message in the console.


To run the game, simply execute the following:
